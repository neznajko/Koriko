### Koreko
**This** is the last one from *90*, prob***4***. 
It's about a town and its streets, vhich are going
*up* and *down* or stay at the same level betveen *2*
crosses and are either North-South or East-West typeof streets,
[clck](https://ioinformatics.org/files/ioi1990round2.pdf).
Koreko is the town from Ghibli's Kiki anime, becz the heights
of the crosses are given vith respect to the Sea Level.

The problem seems to be fairly easy, although I've experienced some
dificulties both with it's logic and with the language **C++**, 
but that's OK. Basically there is nothing more to be said, 
it's a simple DFSearch problem.
